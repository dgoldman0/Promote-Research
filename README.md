# Promote-Research
 A Project to Promote Scholarly Research and Communication

# Goals and Scope

The goal of this project is to promote open scholarly research and communication, as a whole. Now more than ever, we have the tools to rapidly disseminate and review academic research. While traditionally, distribution of such research has been tied to journals, things are changing. Preprints are becoming more commonly used in a variety of fields, and open access has increased the ability for researchers to review existing work. However, preprints are, as their name implies, seem as the first step in the academic communication process, and traditional journal publication is still the gold standard.

It is time for this old system to come to an end. That's where this project comes in. Using open publication and tokenization, we hope that open publication and review will become the new standard. We also hope to see academics generate revenue directly from their work, rather than being totally reliant on traditional academic institutions and government issued grants.

This project will seek to support academics of all types, including institutional academics who work for research firms or universities, as well as independent academics. The latter group especially needs our support. While a lot of research can potentially be conducted without the backing of an institution, it is more difficult to get recognition and funding.

# Tokenization of Research

Cryptoasset tokenization has been abused by ICOs, but the idea of tokenization itself is brilliant. Many important activities in the modern world are difficult to monetize, in part because they involve the creation of ideas, rather than physical goods or services that can be sold. In the case of academic research, the goal is to promote knowledge, and we do not wish to see new ideas kept private for personal benefit. And yet, we must be able to find a way to reward those people who add to the body of academic knowledge.

That's where the ACW (Academic Reward) Token comes into play. The token will be given to academics who publish useful content, and who interact with that content.

# Registration Reward

Every researcher with a valid ORCID identification will be able to register and immediately receive 25 ACWs. If they were referred by someone else, that person will also receive 25 tokens. The ORCID requirement is to help reduce the number of duplicate and spam accounts on the platform.

## Tipping

The next option for receiving ACW is through tipping. Users will be able recommend a research item to their network. Doing so costs two ACW, one of which will go to the author, and the other will go to a pool. A consensus algorithm will be used to distribute the pool back to tippers.

# An Ecosystem for Academics

## Crowdfunding

Crowdfunding has really started to come into its own in recent years. Various crowd funding operations have helped numerous startups and have helped many businesses expand into new projects. In more recent years, crowd funding services have emerged to help fund academics. Perhaps the most well known research crowdfunding platform right now is "[experiment](http://experiment.com)." There's nothing wrong with this platform. But we think that there's room for a few more research crowdfunding services.

## Review Journal

While the goal is to ensure that all viable scholarly material gets published in an open way, there is something to be said about editorial review. These reviews often allow those who are not as well versed in the specific area of study to learn about new publications. And so, in order to communicate with a wider audience, we will be releasing a journal that summarizes select publications and results, which will be available for purchasing using ACW.

## Supplies

As the platform grows, we plan to add access to numerous resources that will be useful to academics, including academic editing services. These services will be available for purchase using ACW. Depending on the ability to remain competitive, we also plan on offering cloud computing services, however large companies like Google and Amazon may have too much of a competitive advantage, even over a non-profit operation like ours.
